# 👨‍💻 About Me
👋 I'm **Raju Bista**, a Ph.D. student and a Research Assistant at the [Forest Genetics Lab](https://www.canr.msu.edu/Forest-Genetics-Lab/index) at the [Department of Forestry](https://www.canr.msu.edu/for/index), Michigan State University. My research interests lie in understanding adaptive mechanisms in forest populations amidst changing environments. Currently, I am employing dendrogenomic approaches to investigate genetic diversity, quantitative traits, and genomic signatures influencing the resilience and adaptability of white spruce populations in Alaska.

Before joining the lab, I participated in research projects focused on dendroclimatology and subalpine forest dynamics in the Nepal Himalaya, southeast France, and California. I hold an MS in Environmental Science from Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu Nepal, an M2 from AgroParisTech, Nancy, France, and an MS in Environmental Science from California State University Dominguez Hills, Carson, California.
